# How it Works

This project is a fully responsive **personal portfolio website** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It showcases my projects, skills, and experiences with interactive navigation, tabbed content, hover effects, and smooth scrolling. The site is designed for cross-device compatibility with flexbox, CSS grid, and media queries.

## Structure & layout

The website is organized into multiple sections:

- **Header** → Hero section with navigation menu, introduction text, and responsive background image.  
- **About** → Includes skills, experiences, and education, displayed in **tabbed content** controlled by JavaScript.  
- **Portfolio** → A **grid-based project gallery** with hover overlays and expandable “See more” functionality.  
- **Contact** → Contact form integrated with Google Sheets, plus links to social profiles and resume download.

## Interactive features

- **Responsive navigation menu** → Hamburger menu toggled via JavaScript for smaller screens.  
- **Tabbed content** → Users can switch between *Skills*, *Experiences*, and *Education* without leaving the page.  
- **Project gallery** → Built with CSS grid, featuring hover overlays, expandable sections, and direct links to GitHub/Power BI projects.  
- **Smooth scrolling** → `scroll-behavior: smooth` for clean navigation transitions.  
- **Form submission** → Integrated with a **Google Apps Script backend** to automatically save messages into Google Sheets and provide user feedback on submission success.

## Frontend design techniques

- **Flexbox & CSS Grid** → Used for layouts across About and Portfolio sections, ensuring consistency and responsiveness.  
- **Media queries** → Optimized typography, spacing, and layouts for **desktop, tablet, and mobile** views.  
- **Hover effects & overlays** → CSS transitions to animate project thumbnails and display descriptions on hover.  
- **Custom styling** → Used a consistent color palette, typography, and spacing system for a professional aesthetic.

## Key technologies used

- **HTML5** → Semantic structure for accessibility and SEO.  
- **CSS3** → Flexbox, Grid, transitions, hover overlays, and media queries for responsiveness.  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** → Tab switching, navigation toggling, project gallery expansion, and form handling.  
- **Google Apps Script** → Backend integration for dynamic form submissions stored in Google Sheets.  
- **FontAwesome** → Icon library for UI elements.

## Challenges I solved

- **Responsive design** → Built with mobile-first media queries and tested across screen sizes from **phones (≤600px)** to **desktop (≥1200px)**.  
- **Interactive project gallery** → Implemented a “See more” button to dynamically toggle visibility of additional projects.  
- **Form integration** → Configured a Google Apps Script endpoint to handle POST requests from the contact form and update a Google Sheet.  
- **Cross-browser testing** → Ensured consistency in Chrome, Firefox, and mobile Safari.
